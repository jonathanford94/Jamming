## Jammming 🎵

Jammming is a React web app with a purpose of allowing users to build playlists which can then be added to their account. It was built using the Spotify API, in which a user can log into their account (via Spotify) allowing Spotify content to be retrieved, playlists to be created and then posted to the user's Spotify account.
